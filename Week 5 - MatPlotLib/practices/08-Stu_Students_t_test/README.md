# T-Test

## Instructions

Using data in files:
    * Resources/wba_data.csv
    * Resources/general_heights.csv

Read into a Pandas DataFrame.

Using a T-test, determine if difference in sample means is significant or not and print a message stating the case.

Plot an error bar of the heights including the standard error of the mean.

Use an integer index starting at 0 for the X-axis and the means as the Y-axis.
