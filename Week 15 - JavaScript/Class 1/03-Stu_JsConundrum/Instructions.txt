•	Instructions:
  ◦	Constructing conditional statements in JavaScript is not all that different from creating small coding mazes. Variables must navigate their way through a series of twists and turns as they attempt to make their way to a desired output. 
  ◦	In this activity, you will be tasked with creating a small maze of conditionals for a variable to navigate its way through. After constructing your maze, share it with your fellow students over slack before attempting to solve the miniature mazes they have created as well. 

•	Hint:
  ◦	For an example as to how these kinds of mazes should look, open up the sample file provided within your IDE and browser. While this puzzle is quite simple to solve it should give you an idea on what to create.
