# Insert entries for yourself and the people in your row in a classroom collection.
# Each document should have:

# 3. A field of the person's favorite Python library, e.g. pandas.

# B. Use find commands to get:
# 1. A list of everyone in a particular row.

# Bonus:
# If you finish early, check out the MongoDB documentation
# and figure out how to find users by an entry in an array.
